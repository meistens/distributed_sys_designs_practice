* 1
Normal stuff

* 2
Server with self-signed cert will not work if used alone, unless the
client has a copy

* 3
GraphQL and RPCs for APIs. RPC in the book, debug as it returns null
data

* 4
Clusters (workers) for scaling servers. Needs 1, meaning it can be
used/seperated as a config/utility.

But it is nit efficient because it is antipattern and does not scale
well with gRPCs (makes clustering redundant). While this bit seems
okay, best not use em for real projects (hobbies, maybe)

* 5
HAproxies.
